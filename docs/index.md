# Knowledge Project Guidelines

Knowledge Project Guidelines is collection of standards, conventions and best practices to follow when developing software at knowledge.io. This is used at Knowledge projects such as [knowledgewallet.com](knowledgewallet.com).

Through this website you will be able to learn what's engineering dna at knowledge.io and find documentation relevant to project management, architecture, code quality and standards.

## Our Engineering Culture

We are fast paced startup with really talented engineers who love open source and agile principles, and that's reflected on our way to build software. At knowlege.io we value:

### transparency, communication and openness
We believe in honesty, transparency and openness as pillars to create a solid and healthy environment were one can develop to its full potential.  

### value delivery focus
We focus on delivering value above all, it’s at the base of all our decisions. We make sure everything we do delivers value both to our users and clients.

### freedom to explore ideas
We are constantly improving and evolving, we are always looking for better and more effective ways, we value exploration, experimentation and open-mindedness.

### lightweight agility
We work with agile/lean methods and kanban to deliver the highest amount of business value to the customer as fast as possible, keeping what works best and discarding rigid rules that are more trouble than they’re worth. We value agile principles over practices.

### automation of repetitive tasks
Automation is at the top of our priorities, everything from scaffolding to code optimization, testing, deploy and delivery.

### open source projects
We promote participation in open source projects we use as well as open sourcing our projects and tooling.

### participation in the local development communities
We believe that engaging and participating in the development communities allows us and to learn and grow more, at the same time our participation enriches the community in general by sharing our knowledge with others.

### diversity, collaboration and mutual respect
A group of different and diverse minds produce more creative solutions as every individual brings in their talents, their way of thinking, operating and solving problems.

### peer code-reviews
Peer code reviews core to our development process, we believe it is one of the best ways to improve quality and spread knowledge.

### continuous integration
Continuous integration allows us to detect problems early reducing costs and help us deliver robust software more rapidly.

### retrospectives
Whenever something goes wrong we don’t point fingers or blame, rather we prefer to make a retrospective meeting and learn from what went wrong.

### freedom to work from anywhere you want
We are fully distributed team, in the 21st there’s no real need to be stuck in traffic jams and loose time of your life moving from one place to another to work on software development. We meet in person from time to time when required to analyze and coordinate work.


## Architecture

At knowledge.io we have most of our infrastructure on AWS and we favor serverless architectures.
